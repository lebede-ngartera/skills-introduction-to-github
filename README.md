I design and build **risk-aware, production-grade AI systems** for high-stakes environments where **uncertainty, accountability, and reliability** are as critical as predictive performance.

My work operates at the intersection of **applied mathematics, machine learning research, and real-world deployment**, with a focus on healthcare, security, and enterprise decision systems. I specialize in translating peer-reviewed research into AI systems that can be **evaluated rigorously, monitored continuously, and trusted in production**.

This GitHub documents selected **research-driven implementations, system architectures, and open-source tools** that reflect how I approach AI engineering: not as demos or benchmarks, but as systems that must behave correctly under uncertainty, distribution shift, and operational constraints.

## Mission

**Build AI systems that remain reliable when assumptions break.**

This means:
- Making uncertainty explicit rather than implicit  
- Designing for distribution shift and data imbalance  
- Evaluating beyond single benchmark metrics  
- Preserving human accountability in decision workflows

## Core Technical Focus

### Machine Learning & AI
- Bayesian and probabilistic modeling  
- Risk-aware classification and decision systems  
- Classical machine learning (logistic regression, tree-based models, ensembles)  
- Neural networks with uncertainty quantification  
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with evaluation discipline  

### Data Science & Modeling
- Statistical learning and inference  
- Feature engineering under real-world constraints  
- Calibration, bias–variance analysis, and error decomposition  
- Robust evaluation and leakage-aware pipelines  

### Systems & MLOps
- End-to-end ML pipelines (training, validation, deployment)  
- Reproducibility, schema control, and versioned artifacts  
- Model monitoring, drift awareness, and failure-mode analysis  
- CI/CD practices for machine learning systems  

### Languages & Stack
- Python, R, SQL  
- scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow  
- Pandas, NumPy, Spark  
- Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure) and containerized workflows  

### Visualization & Communication
- Model diagnostics and error analysis  
- Uncertainty and distribution visualization  
- Clear technical communication for non-technical stakeholders
